# BabyCryToText
![Alt text](https://github.com/thientvse/BabyCryToText/blob/master/cover.png?raw=true "Title")

BabyCry is an android application to help parents understand the crying of babies. Young parents who have not experienced baby care will be more confident, not more worried when their babies cry. 
They will use their smartphone to listen to the baby's crying and the application will analyze and give a result of what the baby needs (demanding food, changing diapers, needing hug, demanding to go to sleep).
I will use the Tensorflow, Firebase to analyze baby cries. The application will also contribute a baby's cry to the corresponding need to improve accuracy.

# Google's Support :
For this project, I need :
- Technology advice.
- Interface design advice.

I need a huge amount of data on baby cries. to be able to build a more accurate model. And I also look forward to your advice on the future development direction of the application in the future.
